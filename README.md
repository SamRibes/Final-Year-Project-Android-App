# Final Year Project App
This repo holds all the files for an Android app that was used as part of my final year project for university.

It displays data that is collected by a Raspberry Pi with connected sensors (soil moisture, light level, temperature and humidity sensors) and then provides suggestions on how to take care of the plant in the moment by feeding the data through an expert system.
